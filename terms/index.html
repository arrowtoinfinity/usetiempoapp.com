            <h2>2. Registration and Accounts</h2>
            <h3>2.1 Eligibility</h3>
            <p>The Services are intended solely for persons who are at least 13 years old or such higher age as required in your country to use the Services. If you are under the legal age to form a legally binding contract in your jurisdiction, you represent that your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to these Terms on your behalf.</p>
            <p>If you are a parent or legal guardian of a Tiempo user under the legal age to form a binding contract in your jurisdiction, you agree to be fully responsible for the acts or omissions of such user, including any breach of these Terms. Notwithstanding, Tiempo reserves the right to refuse access to the Services by users under certain ages, in our sole discretion.</p>

            <h3>2.2 Account Registration</h3>
            <p>To use the Services, you must register. In doing so, you agree to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself ("User Data") and (b) maintain and promptly update the User Data. You agree that Tiempo may use your User Data to provide Services that you access or use and as otherwise set forth in these Terms and our Privacy Policy.</p>
            <p>You also agree to create only one account for your own personal use and not share your account or Tiempo subscription with others. You agree that all activities associated with your account on the Services reflect authentic activities undertaken by you.</p>
            <p>If you provide any User Data that is inaccurate or not current, you have created multiple accounts, or Tiempo has reasonable grounds to suspect that such User Data is inaccurate or not current, Tiempo has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse current or future use of the Services.</p>
            <p>In consideration of your use of the Services, you represent that you are not a person barred from receiving services under the laws of any applicable jurisdiction.</p>

            <h3>2.3 Account Security</h3>
            <p>You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the password associated with your account and for restricting access to your password, your computer and mobile device while logged into the Services. You accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or from your computer and mobile devices.</p>
            <p>You agree to immediately notify Tiempo of any unauthorized use of your account or password, or any other breach of security, and confirm that you understand all risks of unauthorized access to User Data and any other information or content you provide to Tiempo. The use of unique and complex passwords is highly recommended for security reasons.</p>

            <h3>2.4 Third-Party Sign-In</h3>
            <p>You may register for or log-in to your account via a third-party network, such as Apple, Google, or Facebook. If you do so, you will authorize Tiempo to pre-populate the registration and other relevant information fields of your account and/or to use such third-party credentials to log you into your account, based on those companies' privacy policies. If you connect your account to a third-party network, you agree to comply with the terms and conditions and policies applicable to such third party.</p>
            <p>By virtue of certain of the Services connecting to third-party APIs (such as Apple HealthKit, Google Fit, or calendar services), you hereby agree to be bound by those providers' terms of service and privacy policies in connection with your use of such Services.</p>

            <h2>3. Payments and Subscriptions</h2>
            <h3>3.1 Payment Methods</h3>
            <p>To pay any fee, you must designate and provide information about your preferred payment method (e.g., credit card, online payment service, a third-party platform like Apple App Store or Google Play, or any other payment method made available by Tiempo) (the "Payment Method"). If you provide your payment information, you authorize us and certain third-party service providers, payment card networks and payment processors to receive, store, and encrypt your payment information.</p>
            <p>You may switch to a different Payment Method or update your information by visiting your account settings. If you paid through the Google Play or Apple App Store, you may change your Payment Method through the corresponding store account. No refunds or credits will be provided by Tiempo, other than as set forth in these Terms.</p>
            <p>If your payment provider determines that there are fraudulent charges on your account resulting from use of your Payment Method at the Services, please contact us immediately via our support channels.</p>

            <h3>3.2 Subscription Fees</h3>
            <p>In order to access certain functionality of the Services, you may be required to pay subscription fees. Subscription fees, along with any required taxes, are payable in advance. Changes in rates will take effect at the beginning of the next billing date.</p>
            <p>You agree to pay the subscription fees, and other charges you incur in connection with your Tiempo account, whether on a one-time or subscription basis. Tiempo reserves the right to increase subscription fees, any associated taxes, or to institute new fees at any time upon reasonable advance notice.</p>

            <h3>3.3 Auto-Renewal</h3>
            <p>Subscription fees will be billed automatically at the start of the monthly or annual period, as applicable.
